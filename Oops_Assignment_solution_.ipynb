        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Encapsulation: This concept involves bundling data and methods that manipulate that data into a single unit, called a class or object. This helps protect the data from external interference and misuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Abstraction: Abstraction involves showing only the necessary information to the outside world while hiding the implementation details. This helps reduce complexity and improve modularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Inheritance: Inheritance allows one class to inherit properties and behavior from another class. This promotes code reuse and facilitates the creation of a hierarchy of related classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Polymorphism: Polymorphism enables objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This allows for more flexibility in programming, as objects of different classes can respond to the same method call.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Composition: Composition involves combining objects or classes to form new objects or classes. This helps create complex objects from simpler ones.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "These five concepts work together to provide a robust framework for designing, developing, and maintaining software systems.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Some additional key OOP concepts include:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Class: A blueprint or template for creating objects.\n",
        "- Object: An instance of a class.\n",
        "- Method: A function that belongs to a class or object.\n",
        "- Attribute: Data associated with a class or object.\n",
        "- Interface: A contract specifying methods that must be implemented.\n",
